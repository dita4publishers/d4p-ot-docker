Out of the Box DITA OT Container
================================

Provides a working container that provides
just the DITA for Publishers EPUB transform.

It defines one volume in addition to the
two volumes defined by the dita-ot-base
container:

- /opt/dita-ot/DITA-OT is the full DITA-OT itself

NOTE: Use the image dita4publishers/dita-ot-base-epub as the extension base for new
EPUB-only images that need to include additional plugins (e.g., local doctype shells,
EPUB extensions, HTML customizations, etc.)
