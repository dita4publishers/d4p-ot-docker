DITA For Publishers DITA Open Toolkit Project Docker Configurations
===================================================================

Configures Docker containers for DITA Open Toolkit with the DITA for Publishers
and dependency DITA Community Open Toolkit plugins installed.

The dita-ot-base container provides an extendable container that can be used to
create additional containers with additional plugins or other resources added.

The dita-ot container is a working container that provides the volumes needed
by other containers to work with the Open Toolkit or use the container with
files on the host machine. It cannot be used for extension (because the volume
containing the Open Toolkit itself gets reset on subsequent layers once it's
set in the Dockerfile).

The base container defines two volumes intended to be mount points
for host directories:

- VOLUME /opt/dita-ot/data - Mount directory containing the source data to process. Because of permissions complexities under 
Windows and OS X this is effectively a read-only directory.
- VOLUME /opt/dita-ot/out - Mount directory to hold output. This directory must be writable by the OT process, 
so under Windows and OS X this may need to be a directory in the Docker machine running the container,
e.g., /srv/dita-ot/out. You can access this directory in various ways, including using secure copy (scp) or
rsync from the docker machine. 

In addition, working DITA OT containers should define the volume /opt/dita-ot/DITA-OT, which makes
the DITA OT itself available to other containers via the --volumes-from Docker runtime parameter.
